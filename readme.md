# Personal dotfiles of Diederik De Clippel

Using chezmoi dotfile manager and a lot of github dotfiles examples.
My goal is to have a minimal develop machine correctly installed with all necessary tools.

Starting installation:

```bash
sh -c "$(wget -qO- https://bit.ly/ddcdotfiles)"
```

or

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -L https://bit.ly/ddcdotfiles)"
```
